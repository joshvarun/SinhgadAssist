BE Computer Final Year Project. 

The application provides a support system for students who plan to opt
for engineering. It aims at clarifying doubts related to engineering, various
streams and the admission procedure. The application also suggests the
suitable stream and college to the user along with the locality information. It
notifies the user if an important deadline is approaching so that no important
form and document submission deadlines are missed. For students wanting
further assistance, the application provides an option to book an appointment
with an external counselling agency. All this functionality is provided in the
form of an Android application.

University admissions are one of the most important part of a studentâ€™s
career. Hence, choosing the right college for the right student is a highly
challenging task. Although many universities have adapted to centralized
admissions, the system is not efficient and a lot of time is spent in securing
an admission in the institutes. This is primarily due to large number of
applications being submitted to universities every year.
Millions of students apply for engineering admissions every year. A
large number of students are unaware of the procedure. It is important that
the students choose the right branch of engineering that is beneficial for their
future as well as for the development of the country.
This project will help students choose the right stream of engineering
and also help them follow deadlines and important announcements.
